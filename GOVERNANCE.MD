## Special Interest Groups (SIGs) & Working Groups (WGs)

It is the responsibility of the TSC to organize SIGs and temporary working groups to address technical issues based on the needs of the community.  Any project participant may suggest a SIG for long term focus or a working group for a short term project through a pull request to the community repository that creates a directory for the SIG and a readme based on the [prototype](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/blob/main/prototypes/sig-README-template.md).

## Technical Standards Process

The TSC ensures the quality of technical changes. Discussions occur transparently in the repository under [RFDs](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/roadmap/issues), modeled after practices from the [IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3) and [Oxide](https://oxide.computer/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion).

**Currently, the project is evaluating whether to adopt a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) or a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). A formal decision will be documented here once finalized.**

## Community Values

See **[Values Document](values.md)** for the principles that guide our collaboration.
