## Mission

The mission of the OpenCHAMI consortium is to steward the collaborative development and continuous evolution of cloud-like software to manage High Performance Computing capacity regardless of the size or deployment platform.  We are guided by the operators and practitioners who use modern tooling and concepts to address the needs of classical HPC applications and the growing AI/ML and Data Science community that wish to leverage HPC capacity within their own workflows, to meet their needs with their own tools.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the project, the best way to get started is through our [Quickstart Guide](https://openchami.org/guides/getting_started/) which can have OpenCHAMI installed and ready in less than 90 seconds.  To learn more, please join our Slack through this [Invite Link](https://join.slack.com/t/openchami/shared_invite/zt-2m22kqqmq-~zI7gcVYk~0EGTdbkGXlsg).

### Contributing

All development of OpenCHAMI takes place in public in this GitHub Organization.

* We report on our progress to the OpenCHAMI Board through our [Roadmap Project](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCHAMI/projects/1)
* We review issues daily based on recent updates. [Recently Updated Issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AOpenCHAMI++&type=issues&state=open&s=updated&o=desc)
* We review the open pull requests daily. [Recently Updated PRs](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AOpenCHAMI++&type=pullrequests&s=updated&o=desc&state=open)

All repositories in the OpenCHAMI github organization share the same [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which can both be found in the organization's [.github](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github) repository.

General Development Ideas are tracked in our [roadmap](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/roadmap) repository.  To get a common view of active development across all repositories, review the main [Roadmap Project](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCHAMI/projects/1).  Development issues from all repositories should be linked there for easy collaboration.

We welcome feedback and PRs from the community!
