# Security Policy

We take the security of our OpenCHAMI seriously. This document explains how to report vulnerabilities and how we handle them.

## ðŸš¨ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead:
- Email us at **security@openchami.org**  

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

## ðŸ›  Our Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
2. We will investigate and provide a target date for a fix (if confirmed).
3. We will coordinate disclosure with you, ensuring you are credited if desired.
4. A security advisory and patch release will be published once resolved.

## ðŸ“¢ Public Disclosure

We strive for responsible disclosure. Security advisories will be published in:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Mailing list / community announcements

Thank you for helping keep our community safe!
