# This workflow welcomes first-time contributors to the repository.
# It runs on pull requests that are opened and uses the `garg3133/welcome-new-contributors` action
# to greet the contributor and provide instructions on how to sign off their commits.
# The action uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret to authenticate and post a message in the pull request.
# The message includes a one-liner command to set up Git for DCO sign-off.
# This workflow is intended to be used in the OpenCHAMI repository to ensure that
# new contributors are welcomed and informed about the DCO requirements.

            OpenCHAMI requires a **DCO sign-off** on every commit.
            Run the one-liner below to configure Git and auto-enforce sign-off locally:
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/main/scripts/setup-dco.sh | bash
            ```
