# OpenCHAMI CODEOWNERS Example
#
#  Purpose  Ensure every change receives review from a *neutral* set of maintainers
#            drawn from different organisations.  Primary ownership is by scoped
#            GitHub Teams (created under the OpenCHAMI org) rather than individuals.
#  Rule order Top -> bottom; first match wins.
# OpenCHAMI  –  Example CODEOWNERS file that can be copied to new repos.
#
# Each service repo (smd, bss, magellan, …) should have its own
# CODEOWNERS file that points to the appropriate maintainer team.  See below
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Global fallback – anything not caught by a later rule
*                           @openchami/tsc



# Global fallback – if nothing below matches, the TSC reviews
*                               @openchami/tsc

# Notes
# • Teams like @openchami/smd-maintainers should contain *at least two* people
#   from different member organisations to keep governance vendor-neutral.
# • The @openchami/tsc team should include all current TSC members and acts as
#   the “catch-all” reviewer if no more-specific match exists.
# • Update this file whenever you add a new top-level directory or create a
#   dedicated working group.
