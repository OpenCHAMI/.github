# Support

Thank you for your interest in OpenCHAMI! This document outlines how to get help and support.

## ðŸ’¬ Where to Ask Questions

- **GitHub Discussions**: Use the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCHAMI/discussions) for general questions, ideas, or community help.
- **Issues**: Use the [Issues tab](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/issues) only for reporting reproducible bugs or requesting new features.
- **Slack**: Please join our [Public Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/openchami/shared_invite/zt-2xn9wctqq-tptRqPUeFQtTsENRkrCkBg) to connect directly with the rest of the community.

## ðŸš¨ For Urgent Issues

## ðŸ™‹ Getting Help Faster

When asking for help, please include:
- Steps to reproduce the problem
