# Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) Setup Guide

OpenCHAMI enforces the use of the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org) to ensure contributions are made in compliance with licensing requirements and contributor rights.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What Is a DCO?

The DCO is a lightweight alternative to Contributor License Agreements (CLAs). It requires developers to sign off their commits, certifying that they have the right to submit the code under the projectâ€™s license.

Each signed commit must include this line:

Signed-off-by: Your Name your.email@example.com


This is added automatically when using the `-s` flag with `git commit`.

---

## âœ… For Contributors: How to Comply with DCO

### 1. One-Time Git Setup
If you havenâ€™t configured your Git name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 2. Optional: Run the Setup Script
We provide a setup script to configure Git and install a commit hook that enforces DCO locally. You can also access the script  at https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/scripts/setup-dco.sh 

``` bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/main/scripts/setup-dco.sh | bash
```

### 3. Sign Off Your Commits

Use the `-s` flag every time you commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add feature"
``` 

### Forgot sign-off?
Use the  --amend -s to fix last commit 
```bash
git commit --amend -s lastcommit
```
